## Why SCSS Was Used

SCSS was chosen instead of plain CSS to:

- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Use variables for spacing, colors, and themes
- Create reusable and modular styles
- Improve readability and scalability
- Support light/dark theming efficiently

All SCSS files are compiled into a single CSS file (`css/main.css`) for browser compatibility.

---

## Light / Dark Theme

- Implemented using CSS variables
- Toggle button positioned at the top-right corner
- Smooth transition between themes
- Theme state handled using JavaScript

---

## Responsiveness

- Desktop: Two-column layout
- Tablet: Adjusted spacing and layout
- Mobile: Single-column stacked layout
- Tested for overflow and readability

---

## Git Discipline

- Public GitHub repository
- Multiple small commits
- Meaningful commit messages
- Clear development progression
